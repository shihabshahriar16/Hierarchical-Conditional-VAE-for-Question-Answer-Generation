# Hierarchical-Conditional-VAE-for-Qusetion-Answer-Generation
An Implementation of the paper "Generating Diverse and Consistent QA pairs from Contexts with HCVAE" in a Google Colab Notebook

The notebook is based of the work of the repo [https://github.com/seanie12/Info-HCVAE](https://github.com/seanie12/Info-HCVAE). I have adopted the code for running the model in a straightforward way in Google Colab.

The embedding model and the tokenizer can be easily changed by changing the arguments to run the model in any language dataset.
